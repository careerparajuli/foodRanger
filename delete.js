        "So they Advertise they are New Mexican style with the hottest Chile But that is far from what they have nothing like New Mexico green Chile the “green” sauce is orange and sour the hot Chile might be mild at best super disappointing would not recommend if you want real New Mexican style food and good Chile but service was good and people were nice just the food sucked in my opinion since I was born and raised in New Mexico my expectations were very high"
